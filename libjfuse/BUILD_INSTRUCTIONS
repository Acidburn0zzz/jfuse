libjfuse compile instructions and prerequisites for different systems
=====================================================================

In general, jFUSE needs the following to compile:
- A C++ compiler. Only GCC (g++) has been tested.
- FUSE libraries and headers (for FUSE 2.6 or later).
- A Java JDK >= 1.5 with the appropriate machine-specific headers.
- A fairly recent version of pkg-config.

Here are some more specific instructions for specific supported platforms:


1. Linux
--------

To compile libjfuse on a common Linux distribution you need the following:
- The GCC C++ compiler (g++).
    Debian package: g++
    Fedora package: gcc-c++
- libfuse >= 2.6 + headers.
    Debian package: libfuse-dev
    Fedora package: fuse-devel
- A Java JDK >= 1.5, for instance OpenJDK 6 with 'javac' in the PATH.
    Debian package: openjdk-6-jdk
    Fedora package: java-1.6.0-openjdk-devel
- libattr headers (extended attribute function prototypes and constants).
    Debian package: libattr1-dev
    Fedora package: libattr-devel
- pkg-config (a recent version).
    Debian package: pkg-config
    Fedora package: pkgconfig

Tested with Fedora 12 (amd64).


2. Mac OS X
-----------

To compile libjfuse on Mac OS X you need the following:
- Xcode Tools (includes gcc/g++ and system headers).
    http://developer.apple.com/TOOLS/Xcode/
- MacFUSE 2.0 or later.
    http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/
- Java JDK 5 or later (included in Mac OS X 10.5+).
    http://developer.apple.com/java/download/
- pkg-config (a recent version).
    You can either install it from MacPorts / Fink, or compile it yourself from
    sources (http://pkg-config.freedesktop.org/).

Tested with Mac OS X 10.4 (Intel/PowerPC), Mac OS X 10.5 (Intel/PowerPC).


3. OpenSolaris
--------------

To compile libjfuse on OpenSolaris you need the following:
- The GCC C++ compiler (g++).
    Included in the package 'gcc-dev'.
- libfuse and the fusefs kernel module.
    You have to build these manually from Mercurial source repositories.
    See instructions (written for NTFS-3G) here:
      http://forums.opensolaris.com/thread.jspa?threadID=513
    Stop after the line:
      '$ pfexec /usr/sbin/pkgadd -d ../../libfuse/packages SUNWlibfuse'
- JDK 5 or later.
    Sun's JDK 6.0 can be found in the packages 'SUNWj6dev' (32-bit) and
    'SUNWj6dvx' (64-bit). The 'java-dev' package includes these and some more
    potentially useful tools for Java development.
- pkg-config (a recent version).
    Included in the package 'SUNWgnome-common-devel'.

Tested with OpenSolaris 2009.06.


4. FreeBSD
----------

- The GCC C++ compiler (g++). This is usually included in FreeBSD but if not,
  then check the 'lang' section in the ports tree.
- The FUSE kernel module and libraries. Both can be found in the ports tree as
  sysutils/fusefs-kmod and sysutils/fusefs-libs respectively.
- A JDK >= 1.5. Diablo JDK 1.6 and OpenJDK 6 are recommended. Both can be found
  in the ports tree as java/diablo-jdk16 and java/openjdk6 respectively.
- pkg-config. This can be found in the ports tree as devel/pkg-config.

Tested with FreeBSD 7.2 and FreeBSD 8.0 (both amd64 architecture).


5. NetBSD
---------

- The GCC C++ compiler (g++) (included in the standard install of NetBSD 5.0.1).
- librefuse / puffs (included in the standard install of NetBSD 5.0.1).
- A JDK >= 1.5 (I used OpenJDK 7, which is in pkgsrc as 'lang/openjdk7-bin').

Tested with NetBSD 5.0.1 (i386).
